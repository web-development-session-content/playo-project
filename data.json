Apart from that I look out for the basic inclination towards the game, the passion and the willingness to work hard and constant surge for improvement. The natural flair is an added advantage. I feel proud to say that Virat possess all these qualities ever since he has joined, at that time he was 8 yr old.

Deodhar and Vijay Hazare - among others - who have made India proud with their accomplishments, owe their success to the rigorous training they received at PYC.  The Club started functioning with a handful of indoor games like chess, carom and billiards.  Soon after, some spirited women, with support from a Good Samaritan, established the Ladies’ Branch of the PYC with the aim of bringing all the female members on a common platform.  The Club has a rich tradition of organizing State and National level tournaments in cricket, basketball, tennis and badminton. Apart from this the Club is proud to have hosted International level tournaments in the field of Billiards and Snooker.  What began as a simple sport-promotion initiative has now transformed into one of the top clubs in town with best-in-class facilities.",
