                    This fairytale, like all fairytales, started with a few dudes in distress. One was lamenting his dear departed tennis partner,<br>
                    the second grieving for the badminton racquet left behind, the third desolate after another football weekend that never<br>
                    happened, the fourth broke and gymless from another membership waylaid, and the fifth just #bored to death. Alas, unlike<br>
                    in other fairytales, no fair damsel came to their rescue and they wallowed for a while in their sorrow. And so they finally<br>
                    did what all forsaken souls do...start building their very own Neverland, a place for all restless adrenaline junkies like<br>
                    themselves...and thus a thought, nay a belief called Playo was sown.

                A belief to create a playground where you can fit-in with other fellow misfits, where access is not limited by narrow<br>
                memberships walls. A belief that you can play when you want...where you want...how you want, and not have to suffer the<br>
                agony of wait. A belief to create a world where you can lose yourself and yet rediscover yourself, where you can be both the victor and the vanquished and laugh at being both.<br>
                 A belief...that happiness is a dish best served on the field.
